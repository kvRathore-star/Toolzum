# Toolzum TODO Tracker

Last updated: 2026-08-23

## Quick Wins (do now)
- [x] 1. Generate OG images for 4 new tools + fix default /og-image.png 404 — Ran `npx tsx scripts/generate-og-images.ts`, fixed layout/page.tsx to use `/og/branding/index.png`
- [x] 2. Qualify "zero servers/uploads" copy — Fixed 7 locations: layout, tools/page, about/layout, [category]/page, premium-tools FAQ

## Highest-Risk QA (do next)
- [x] 3. Batch/AI tool QA — Found silent failure pattern in 4 batch tools (fake images accepted silently). Fixed BulkToolShell with createImageBitmap probe at upload time. AI tool 404s are expected (auth endpoint).
- [x] 4. Tablet breakpoint pass — Found header 948px overflow at 768/834px. Fixed: search bar hides text at md, Share/Sign in hidden at md, responsive gaps.

## Preserve Knowledge
- [x] 5. Create docs/gotchas.md — classWorkerURL hang, D1 quota, dynamic-rule-budget, file-size-limit dual sources (30 min)

## Investigate (don't optimize blind)
- [x] 6. Build-time profiling — 12min fresh build: TypeScript 5.5min, compilation 3.2min, SSG 3.2min. Nothing pathological. (15 min)
- [x] 7. Icon system unification — emoji → lucide-react in megamenu/categories (30-60 min)
- [x] 7b. One-way converter upgrade — examples, conversion factors, references for 6 tools; Time & Data Size flipped to two-way; specific FAQs (150 lines)
- [x] 8. Thin-tool audit — merged 3 time converter clones into bidirectional time-converter; upgraded rounding calculator (5 modes + step display); upgraded modulo calculator (JS/Python semantics + long-division); added FAQs for all 3 (commit a796dcc)

## Business decisions (separate thread)
- [ ] 9. Email capture — where do signups go?
- [ ] 10. Annual plan / credit pack — what price/credit size?

## Save for Focus Time
- [ ] 11. FAQ rollout (~1,060 tools) — multi-day
- [x] 12. Registry-import perf rewrite — eliminated 736KB full registry from client bundles; Homepage -567KB (30%), Tool page -734KB (35%) (commit 52dccf2)

## Mechanical (proven playbook, no decision needed)
- [ ] 13. FAQ rollout — Tier 1 done (category templates personalized, commit 296e435). Still pending: custom FAQs for GSC "crawled, not indexed" flagged tools, then general volume rollout. Weekend task.
- [x] 14. ~~Developer dedup~~ — api-response-formatter → json-formatter, api-error-decoder → http-status-code-checker (commit 0b3b4c0)
- [x] 15. ~~Calculator consolidation~~ — 6 tools redirected to geometry/scientific/date calculators (commit 0b3b4c0)
- [x] 16. ~~Transcription reclassification~~ — Renamed to "Audio Transcript Formatter" / "Video Transcript Formatter", fixed descriptions (commit 0b3b4c0)
- [x] 17. ~~Branding AI-claim fix~~ — Already fixed. deps was "None" (now "AI API"), UI saying "AI-powered" is accurate (tool uses useAiProvider). Auto-generated FAQ now correctly states API key required. (commit ed11ea6)

## Needs one strategic decision
- [ ] 18. Productivity category — build out (habit trackers, focus timers, note tools?) or fold 2 tools into Utility and remove category. A 2-tool category looks unfinished next to 60+ tool categories. Recommend fold+kill unless productivity is core to growth strategy

## GSC monitoring (time-gated)
- [ ] 19. Submit IndexNow / re-validate GSC for this round of fixes (classifier, trust bugs, related-tools, FAQ content) — free nudge, do now
- [ ] 20. GSC check at 2 weeks (early signal) — pull crawled-not-indexed list, check Validate Fix progress bars, per-URL indexing status on the174/220 flagged tools
- [ ] 21. GSC check at 4 weeks (real assessment) — same checks, compare against 2-week data. Recovery is often uneven across pages
- [ ] 22. GSC monthly check-in after 4 weeks — light monitoring cadence

## Immediate actions
- [x] 23. ~~Improve 6 category FAQ templates in ToolPageSEOContent.tsx~~ — Templates now personalized per tool (name, description in first2 questions). All818 tools get unique FAQ text, breaking duplicate content pattern. (commit 296e435)

## Prevention (ongoing)
- [ ] 25. Add lint check: new tools without `faqs` field in registry trigger a warning. Prevents future818-tool backlog. Bake into the tool-addition checklist.
- [ ] 26. Add quality gate script: detect generic FAQ text, duplicate FAQ hashes, thin components (<40 lines), one-way converters missing bidirectional UI, identical description/seoDescription. Run as part of content integrity test suite before every commit.
- [ ] 27. Add category-slug validation: maintain a known-good slug→category mapping, flag mismatches at build time. Catches miscategorized tools before they ship.
- [ ] 28. **FAQ depth audit for Formula-type CalculatorShell tools** — ~120 tools use CalculatorShell with Formula classification. The FAQ rollout (item 11/13/23) only solves thin-content if FAQs are genuinely deep (worked examples, derivation steps, edge cases), not generic templates. Before FAQ rollout: audit all Formula tools' registry `faqs` for: step-by-step derivation, worked numeric example, common mistake warnings, formula variant explanations. Flag tools with <4 FAQs or missing worked examples for manual deepening.

SEO: Add unique meta descriptions to top 50 most-visited tools
SEO: Add internal linking between related tools (reduces thin content signals)

 Credits — Default reduced from 100 to 10. Schema, auth config, migration, dashboard bar, and account page all updated. Current cost: 1 credit per AI tool use (generate/transcribe). Free users get 10 credits; Pro gets unlimited.

  Define per-task credit costs (e.g., image gen = 5, text gen = 2, transcription = 3) — currently all 1 credit

1. Truly bare/minimal tools — tools with just a plain form and no styling
2. Calculator-style tools — inputs → calculate/auto → result
Two-column layout (inputs left, result panel right) 
Preset chips for quick values, 
Result panel with stats, copy/download/history
